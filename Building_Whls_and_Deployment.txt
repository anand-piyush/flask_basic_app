# REF : https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/

Create setup.py (generally Created at a step before the package in dir as it picks the name of directory under import, for better ref refer https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/master/setup.py and its dir structure)
use the command      python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel   to install setuptools and wheel
      generally pip freeze doesnt shows as req is generally self satisfied when virtual env is Created
Build using    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
In dist/ you will get the whl file and tar files for distribution

>> now you can host this on pypi or testpypi https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#uploading-the-distribution-archives
>> or can distribute the whl urself
>> whls can be installed manually using the following command
   |||||| if only the single whl dependency is in directory rest all from pypi to be downloaded (recommended to use uninstall before or upgrade commands in case of upgrades)
   pip install simple_flask_app --find-links file:\\\D:\PythonApps\flask_app_iis\dist
   |||||| if all dependencies in dir
   pip install simple_flask_app --find-links file:\\\D:\PythonApps\flask_app_iis\dist --no-index


# for dev run test
# python setup.py develop
# to run test cases run
# python setup.py test 
# for building release distribution wheel run
# python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

>> IIS WEBSITE CAN BE CONFIGURED TO LOOK TO PROJECT FOLDER IN VENV now, means
1. create a new website with the physical path of venv directory
2. follow the steps given in SettingUpOnIIS.txt, pkg directory (src in our case) in Lib\ folder should be the one containing your code now as usual
3 do pip upgrade or remove/install and ur iis will be unaffected

>> for using WAITRESS following commands can be triggered  https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/usage.html
from src import run
import waitress
serve(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)

or on terminal

run following commands
>> activate virtual env
>> waitress-serve src:run.app

############################# APART FROM MANUAL DEPLOYMENT AND SETUP as SUGGESTED ABOVE, AUTOMATED ROUTES CAN ALSO BE FOLLOWED #######################################

1. USE Fabric (works by automating ssh commands on linux). Many other similar tools can be also used if needed an alternative.

2. On windows, we can also use
>> CUSTOM APIs
    A. Build an endpoint for deployment and update and only give rights to you. API should be hosted on your server.That api will contain 
         A.1. Upgrade the api using pip  [the whl file to be placed in shared folders or cloud like internal s3]
         A.2. Restart the server (website)

>> USE RPA or tools like the ones listed on https://4sysops.com/archives/three-ways-to-run-remote-windows-commands/
