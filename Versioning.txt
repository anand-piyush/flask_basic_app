in the root __init__ file in py versioning of the api is done.
The defined variable __version__ is being used everywhere within the app
version can be also viewed via endpoint /api/version or /version or on swagger page


##### BETTER WAY OF DOING THIS IS VIA package setuptools-scm (as per https://ep2015.europython.eu/conference/talks/less-known-packaging-features-and-tricks, users will not be 
able to use this package then 
since you have an internal dependency which users are yet to import)
Better ways of versioning listed https://packaging.python.org/guides/single-sourcing-package-version/
NOTHING "" LIKE THIS "" SHOULD EVER BE imported in setup.py file


# for now i have created a python file named version.py which is being imported everywhere to determine version for the app
# better suggestion is to use setuptools-scm
