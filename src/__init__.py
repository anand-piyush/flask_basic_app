# NOT A GOOD WAY TO MANAGE VERSIONS; as once build, users wont be able to import due to this internal dependency. this is why nothing like this should be imported in setup.py
# REF : https://packaging.python.org/guides/single-sourcing-package-version/. BETTER TO CREATE A TXT/PY FILE INSTEAD OF USING THIS;
# DUE TO THIS REASON COMMENTED BELOW
# FOR MORE DETAILS SEE VERSIONING.TXT. 
# __version__= '1.0.1'
